# Ethiopia-Exposure-Models

This directory contains the Rcodes and SLURM scripts to process various datasets for the Ethiopia PM2.5 and Temperature models. These codes are designed to import the spatial modeling grid, import the dataset to be processed, implement data extract and interpolation to the spatial modeling grid, and write outputs of daily interpolated grids. The folder Rcode contains codes to process the data, the folder Cluster contains scripts for Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) gap-filling models submitted to a HPC that utilizes SLURM. Data are available publicly or upon request.
