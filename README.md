# Ethiopia-Exposure-Models

This directory contains the Rcodes to process various datasets for the Ethiopia PM2.5 and Temperature models. These codes are designed to import the spatial modeling grid, import the dataset to be processed, implement data extract and interpolation to the spatial modeling grid, and write outputs of daily interpolated grids. Data are available publicly or upon request.
